Small Graph Lib

This application supports 2 types of graphs - directed and undirected with 3 operations:

 1. addVertex - adds vertex to the graph
 2. addEdge - adds edge to the graph
 3. getPath - returns a list of edges between 2 vertices (path doesnâ€™t have to be optimal)

 Vertices should be of a user defined type.
